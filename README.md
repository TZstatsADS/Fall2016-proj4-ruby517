+ Projec title: Music Features and Lyrics
+ Project summary: For this project, we use music features to recommend lyrics it may have from the most possible one to the least possible one. I extracted 56 columns of features for each music, used topic modelling to divdide the lyrics into 20 topics and label each music with a topic. Then I used random forest to train a model for predicting topic of a music by its features.
